How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It was much easier to identify the bug
Rather than scanning through every line, you just compare the ones where a change was made

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can spend your time more productively and create a higher quality code. Less time fixing and more time creating.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros - you can make your own judgement and commit when it makes sense logically

Cons - you might get lazy and not commit for a long time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because git is targetted at programming problems.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

using git log you can get a list of all the commits and using git diff you can compare the changes that you made in respective files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

If you break anything, just go back and dismiss the changes or identify what broke the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Programming my web application and maintaining a high level organization of the code
