When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I work from multiple computers or a group is working on the file

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork - if I want to contribute to the repository
clone - if I want to start from where it is and continue my way
branch - my own project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

you can identify changes that have happened since that state both locally and on github.
